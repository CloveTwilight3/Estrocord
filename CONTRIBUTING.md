Guide for Bug Reports

We encourage all contributors to report bugs in order to improve the quality of the project. Please follow these guidelines:

1) Choose the Appropriate Template:
    - Advanced Bug Report: If you are comfortable providing detailed technical information, logs, or stack traces, we recommend using this template. Advanced Bug Reports help us debug and resolve issues more efficiently.

    - Basic Bug Report: If you are not technically inclined or find the Advanced template overwhelming, feel free to use the Basic Bug Report template. We still value all bug reports!

2) Provide Clear and Complete Information:
    - Include as much detail as possible when describing the bug.

    - Attach screenshots or logs if applicable to help explain the issue.

3) Be Respectful and Patient:
    - Remember that this is a collaborative project. We will address issues as quickly as we can.
